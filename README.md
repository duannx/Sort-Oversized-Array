# Sort-Oversized-Array
- Sort 1 million of signed 32-bit integers using 3 MB of memory.
- Input: input.txt store 1 million of signed 32-bit integers seperate by ` `
- Output: result.txt store 1 million of signed 32-bit integers ordered and seperate by ` `
- Note: I use the `sort` function from C++'s STL in my program to sort the array of 500.000 of signed 32-bit integers. I choose that function because it is a simple way and with 500.000 element it doesn't cause over flow memory.
